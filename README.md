# yellow5

This project houses a code kata for using a web framework to generate an HTML page with a yellow 5 in it.

The goals of the kata:

* Try new web frameworks in various languages
* Keep the problem space simple
* Deploy it to Heroku
* Tag history of what was used

Whatever master has will be used to power [The Yellow 5!](http://yellow5.codingpl.us/)
